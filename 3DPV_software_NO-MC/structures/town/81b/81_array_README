Starting from a 35 mm cube in the center (cube-top or tallcube-top), the 
other 8 cubes in the 3x3 matrix are generated by 
translation in the x and y direction by 55 mm. This creates an array of 
9 35 mm (by footprint) cubes separated by 20mm.

the 3x3 array is then replicated in the same way to make a 9x9 array of cubes. THe translation is of 110mm.

All cubes are closed at the top (no internal reflection): these cubes are labeled "-top"

Various models are explored:

1. Simple: all cubes are the same
2. Tall at center: tall (twice as high) cube at center surrounded by regular cubes.
3. Regular at center: regular cube at center, surrounded by tall cubes. 
4. Center "cross" of tall cubes, edges are short.
5. Negative of 4.
