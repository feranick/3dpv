Compilation:

1. From the main folder launch "make"
2. The executable, solar3d, should be present.

Usage:

A script "3dpv"  is provided for a seamless use. 
Two usages:

1. ./3dpv inputfile
   The simulation will be run from the file inputfile (bos-fixed, for 
example), and the data will be saved in bos-fixed-dir. The output will 
be also saved, in the file bos-fixed.out

2. ./3dpv inputfile folder
   Same as above, but the name of the folder now can be specified. 

3. Modify the script in the text editor to change the type of 
simulation:
Change the variable TYPE to:

  0=GA run 1=fixed 2=fixed+mixed (mixed reflectivities/efficiencies)
